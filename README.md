A Dalamud plugin for Final Fantasy XIV.

This repository is for development! If you just want to use this addon, you'll need to install the [FFXIV Quick Launcher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) and read the 
[FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/dalamud_troubleshooting.html#q-how-do-i-installenable-plugins).

Blue Mage Helper is currently pending availability as a testing plugin. See [this page](https://markjsosnowski.github.io/FFXIV/) for pre-testing builds.

found in the open world.

### Planned Features
- Alternate locations and monsters
- Marking enemies with unlockable spells 
- Clickable locations to mark them on the world map
